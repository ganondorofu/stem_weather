- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, will be used for both body text and headlines. Its neutral and modern appearance supports readability and data presentation.
- Use simple, outlined icons to represent weather conditions (e.g., sun, cloud, rain) to enhance visual understanding without cluttering the interface.
- Employ a clean, minimalist layout with a clear separation between the calendar, data visualizations, and summary sections, ensuring a seamless user experience.
- Implement subtle transitions and animations for loading data and switching between dates to provide feedback and maintain user engagement.
